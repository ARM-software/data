If the private L2 cache is not present but the DSU L3 cache is present, the L2D_CACHE* events count activity in the DSU L3 cache and the L3D_CACHE* events do not count. The L2D_CACHE_WB, L2D_CACHE_WR and L2D_CACHE_REFILL_WR events do not count in this configuration. If neither the private L2 cache nor the DSU L3 cache are present, neither the L2D_CACHE* or L3D_CACHE* events will count"
